# ðŸ§­ Zero's Personal Hacker Manifesto

> _Learning, not harming. Curiosity, not chaos. Growth, not ego._

## 1. I test only what I own or have explicit permission to test.
No exceptions. No grey areas. If I canâ€™t prove I had permission, I donâ€™t touch it.

## 2. I respect privacy. Always.
Data I stumble on, I do not save. Credentials I discover, I do not use. Mistakes I find, I report responsibly.

## 3. I never build, run, or distribute malware.
No droppers, no beacons, no sketchy GitHub scripts that pretend to be educational but scream felony.

## 4. I isolate experimentation from my personal life.
My testing environments are clean, compartmentalized, and contain nothing I canâ€™t afford to lose.

## 5. I document everything.
If I didnâ€™t write it down, I didnâ€™t learn it. If I canâ€™t explain it, I donâ€™t understand it.

## 6. I contribute to a safer, smarter tech ecosystem.
I donâ€™t just break thingsâ€”I want to understand, explain, and help fix them.

## 7. I am accountable.
I own my mistakes. I ask before I act. I seek mentorship, not medals.

ðŸ§  **This isnâ€™t a performance. Itâ€™s a practice.**  
I publish tools to learn. I share findings to help.  
I question loudly so others can think quietly.
