# 🧭 Zero's Personal Hacker Manifesto

<div class="manifesto-header">
  > *Learning, not harming. Curiosity, not chaos. Growth, not ego.*
</div>

## 🔒 Permission & Boundaries

### 1. I test only what I own or have explicit permission to test.
No exceptions. No grey areas. If I can't prove I had permission, I don't touch it.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Data Protection

### 2. I respect privacy. Always.
Data I stumble on, I do not save. Credentials I discover, I do not use. Mistakes I find, I report responsibly.

## ⚔️ Malware & Harmful Code

### 3. I never build, run, or distribute malware.
No droppers, no beacons, no sketchy GitHub scripts that pretend to be educational but scream felony.

## 🧪 Safe Experimentation

### 4. I isolate experimentation from my personal life.
My testing environments are clean, compartmentalized, and contain nothing I can't afford to lose.

## 📝 Documentation

### 5. I document everything.
If I didn't write it down, I didn't learn it. If I can't explain it, I don't understand it.

## 🌐 Community Contribution

### 6. I contribute to a safer, smarter tech ecosystem.
I don't just break things—I want to understand, explain, and help fix them.

## 🎯 Accountability

### 7. I am accountable.
I own my mistakes. I ask before I act. I seek mentorship, not medals.

  <p>I publish tools to learn. I share findings to help.</p>
  <p>I question loudly so others can think quietly.</p>
