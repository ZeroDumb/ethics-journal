Welcome to the **ZeroDumb Hacking Journal** - a terminal-first exploration of ethical hacking, AI chaos, security adventures, and digital responsibility. One post at a time.

## Mission

As AI tools become ubiquitous and people use them without understanding the security implications, I'm learning to become a full-blown red teaming, limit-pushing, research-generating, reverse engineering, access and evasion expert.

**Core Belief:** If I'm going to be forced to accept AI tools, I'm going to be an expert at exploiting them to help protect data and our future.

This isn't just a blog - it's a public lab journal documenting the messy, real-world journey of learning ethical hacking. Expect:

- ✅ Real failures and lessons learned
- ✅ Ethical dilemmas and tough decisions  
- ✅ AI tool exploitation (for good)
- ✅ Occasional dumpster fires
- ✅ Security adventures with consequences
- ✅ Zero sugar-coating

## Ethics First

Every tool, technique, and post is designed for:
