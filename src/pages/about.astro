        Curiouser and curiouser, diving or rather falling down the youtube and github rabit holes. Isn't is crazy what you can find online, it's even crazier what can be built in less than 9 hours with assisted coding platforms. No matter how you frame it, vibe, unskilled, script kiddies, idiots, bad for the brand. Whatever. AI coding is likely here to stay, and if it's here and we want to use it, understand it, and grow with it, it's best to push it forward.

        What I do, kind of. I actually setup and build automations and train small models for clients. What I wish I did, I have absolutely no clue, I walked out of the corporate world, abandoned a 15 year life draining career when I was let go using fancy lawyer speak "structured termination" pretty much they offered me a reduced pay and title so low they knew I would quit, forced resignation I guess. Does it matter that I spent 15 years climbing and building and missing 14 years of my childrens life, nope. No body cares. Does it matter that I was replaced that same day by someone I was training? Nope, no one cares. So for the last two years, I have wandered around the internet machines and interwebs desperately trying to find a new home.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What I have found is crap, a load of newbs thinking they're business bro's. So called guru's scamming desperate people into buying their "mastermind" courses, and most recently, a boom of "AI" based businesses. Pretty much everyone running around saying <strong>Make it pretty, have buttons, and be AI</strong> copyrighted.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What else I found is that AI has no sense of ethics, right, wrong, boundaries, or limits. What most people call AI is really just fancy chatbots, and if you do stumble on AI models that have true logic and reasoning beyond hard coded parameters, they can, and likely will, respond and build whatever you ask them to. Especially if you fall into a couple categories.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-terminal-cyan">Categories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>New and clueless</strong>
          <p>These are people who unfortunately fall into the "askhole" category a lot, they're always asking questions instead of doing the work, always looking for more and rarely make it far. Often people who just randomly start using ai tools because they some how stumbled into a youtube video that said they could be a millionaire over night by simply using the affiliate link in the description. Unfortunately, they're also the ones who get scammed the most, and often find themselves in the same boat as the bro's and skid's, or worse, they get so caught up in the hype they don't even realize they're being scammed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trained</strong>
          <p>These are the people who know exactly what they're doing with prompts and possibly even with code itself. Doesn't mean they'll do much with it though, they're often too busy to actually build anything, or they're full time job is to do most of the work and so whenever they log off for the day, that's it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Determined</strong>
          <p>These are people who know it's possible, but don't really know how, but they refuse to stop searching, these are the one's who often figure it out, but, they're also the ones who will accidentally build something that will get them banned from the platform, or worse, they'll build something that will get them sued.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Curious</strong>
          <p>These are the people who refuse to stop searching, they're always asking questions, always looking for more. Sometimes going too far, but they're the ones who's curiosity will likely lead them to the truth.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-terminal-cyan">So, where does that leave me?</h2>
      <p>I'm not sure, but I'm going to keep searching, and I'm going to keep building, and I'm going to keep asking questions. Somewhere in the middle, I'll find my place.</p>
