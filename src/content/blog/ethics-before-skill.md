> “With great power comes great... opportunity to royally screw up.”

When I started learning about ethical hacking and digital security, I assumed the real danger was a lack of technical skill.

Turns out, the real danger is a lack of ethical clarity.

## What I Thought at First

I believed that if I couldn’t build advanced scripts, bypass security, or understand every line of network traffic...  
then I wasn’t a "threat" to anything or anyone.  
I was "safe," in a dumb little way.

What I didn’t realize is that **intent** isn’t validated by skill level.  
Intent leaks into every action you take — **especially early** when you're still learning.

"How you do some things, is normally how you do everything"

A beginner with bad intent + basic tools = real risk.

A beginner with good intent + humility = real growth.

## Why Ethical Intent Matters More Early On

- **Mistakes Happen:**  
  You *will* accidentally overstep. It’s inevitable. Ethical intent ensures you correct and learn, not rationalize and hide it.

- **Shortcuts Are Everywhere:**  
  It's insanely easy to stumble into powerful tools, vulnerable endpoints, or bad practices. Intent prevents weaponizing ignorance.

- **Trust Is Earned Before Skill:**  
  Your technical portfolio matters less than your **track record** of restraint, responsibility, and reflection.

- **Self-Regulation > Regulation:**  
  Nobody is looking over your shoulder. **You are your own supervisor.**

## Lessons I've Started Living By

- I ask: "**Should I?**" more often than "**Can I?**"
- I don't trust AI tools to make ethical calls for me.
- I assume ignorance is still punishable if misused.
- I value documenting mistakes as much as documenting success.
- I view every tool as a double-edged sword.

## Closing Thought

Your skills will grow automatically if you stay curious and consistent.  
But your **ethics** need intentional work, every day.

**Talent is not what makes you dangerous.  
Intent is.**

Stay sharp. Stay grounded. Stay curious. Stay loud.
