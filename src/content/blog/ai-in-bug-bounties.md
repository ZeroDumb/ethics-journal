## The Real Question

When I first stumbled into the world of bug bounty hunting, one of my earliest questions wasn‚Äôt, *"How fast can I exploit something?"*  
It was:  
> *"Can I use AI to help me ‚Äî and if so, how without getting banned, sued, or accidentally becoming a cautionary tale?"*

Not the most glamorous hacker question.  You know, like, **"how can I download the internet"** type thing.

But a smart one.  
And a survival one.

>No one wants to end up on the news, I am no exception, I'd rather ask now, than be told later.

## AI *Can* Help You ‚Äî But...

‚úÖ **You can absolutely use tools like ChatGPT or Claude, or whatever random model, to assist in bug bounty programs.**  
But (and this is a big, neon-glowing BUT) there are **rules** and **common sense boundaries** you *must* respect.

AI can:
- Help brainstorm test cases and fuzzing ideas
- Review API documentation and spot weird endpoints
- Suggest payloads or basic exploit chains, especially if you're using models like <a href="https://www.whiterabbitneo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhiteRabbitNeo &#8599;</a>
- Assist in writing clearer vulnerability reports
- Explain common vulnerabilities like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XSS &#8599;</a>, <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQL Injection &#8599;</a>, and <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDOR &#8599;</a>

But AI **cannot**:
- Autonomously scan, exploit, or interact with targets on your behalf
- Act outside defined scope or responsible disclosure rules
- Submit garbage reports you didn't verify yourself
- Violate specific models terms of use (which still apply, even if you're "being creative")

## Basic Rule of Thumb

**AI = Calculator**  
**You = Math student**

Use it to speed up your brain, not to replace it. Remember: **Don't be dumb**

The second you let it run wild without oversight, you're no longer a clever hacker.  
You're not a hacker at that point ‚Äî you're future Reddit drama with a keyboard.

## Why Asking First *Matters*

Most people crash and burn because they **assume** they understand the rules.  (or worse, that they are somehow smarter than everyone else)
They don't ask.  
They don't read scope.  
They don't think about the ethics.

And then they get kicked off <a href="https://hackerone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerOne &#8599;</a>.  
Or banned from trusted bounty platforms.  
Or worse.

Just the simple fact that you're reading this ‚Äî that you **asked the question** ‚Äî  
already puts you ahead of half the "bug bounty bros" who think hacking is just speedrunning BurpSuite.

This isn't some random lotto, people dedicate large portions of their lives to these, and companies dedicate massive resources.

So repeat after me, "Just because the AI said so, doesn't make it so."

## My Early Thoughts

When I started, I was:
- Broke.
- Curious.
- Pretty unsure what was "legal enough" or "safe enough" to even attempt.
- Reminded that I had already had gaming accounts banned for "bending" boundaries.
- Nervous about looking like a try-hard, in a seemingly silent and otherwise mysterious community.

But I knew one thing:  
I didn‚Äôt want to be another sad Reddit post: *"I got banned from HackerOne, AMA."*

Instead, I wanted to build things the right way, even if it took longer.  
I wanted to be the kind of hacker that companies *wanted* to hear from ‚Äî not the kind they had to call the lawyers about.

In my last career path everyone would joke; sometimes you attend the safety meeting, other times you're the reason for the safety meeting.

## So Here's the Game Plan

If you're thinking about getting into AI-assisted bug bounty work:
1. **Use AI to augment your process**, not to replace your judgment.
2. **Stay within scope. Always.**, if you want to work OOS, do it on your own machines, VM's, or your mom's toaster.
3. **Respect responsible disclosure boundaries.**  
4. **Document when and how AI helped you**, just in case you need to explain later.
5. **Never submit unverified AI guesses.**, all the fancy emojis won't matter when someone flags your submission.   
   *(You will get caught. It‚Äôs embarrassing.)*

Bonus: If you build trust by being cautious, ethical, and clear ‚Äî  
you'll stand out way faster than the speed-clickers chasing $50 bounties. 
Trust is your real zero-day.

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Closing Thought

Hacking is 50% technical skill and 50% *reputation management*.

You‚Äôre not just testing systems.  
You‚Äôre testing yourself ‚Äî your patience, your ethics, your ability to stay smart when it would be easy to be stupid.

Choose wisely.
