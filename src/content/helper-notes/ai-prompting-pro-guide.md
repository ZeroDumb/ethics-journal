# AI Prompting Pro Guide

Master the art of AI prompting with best practices, workflow optimization, context management, and cybersecurity-specific techniques.

## Core Prompting Principles

### The 4 C's Framework
```bash
# Clear - Be specific and unambiguous
❌ "Write a script"
✅ "Write a Python script that scans for open ports on a target IP"

# Concise - Avoid unnecessary words
❌ "Please create a very detailed and comprehensive script"
✅ "Create a script that..."

# Contextual - Provide relevant background
❌ "Fix this code"
✅ "Fix this Python function that handles user authentication"

# Complete - Include all necessary details
❌ "Make it secure"
✅ "Implement input validation, parameterized queries, and error handling"
```

### Role-Based Prompting
```bash
# Define the AI's role
"You are a senior cybersecurity expert with 15 years of experience in penetration testing."

# Specify expertise level
"You are a Python developer specializing in automation and security tools."

# Set expectations
"Provide code that follows OWASP guidelines and includes detailed comments."
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```bash
# Break complex tasks into steps
"Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, analyze the security requirements
2. Then, design the architecture
3. Finally, implement the solution"

# Ask for reasoning
"Explain your thought process as you write this code."
```

### Few-Shot Learning
```bash
# Provide examples
"Here are examples of good prompts:
- 'Create a Python script that scans ports 80,443,8080'
- 'Write a bash script to check system logs'

Now create a similar script for..."

# Show input-output pairs
"Input: 'scan network'
Output: 'nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24'

Input: 'check logs'
Output: 'tail -f /var/log/auth.log'"
```

### Context Window Optimization

#### Managing Long Contexts
```bash
# Use summaries for long documents
"Summarize this 1000-line code file in 3 bullet points, then suggest improvements."

# Break large tasks
"Instead of analyzing the entire codebase, focus on the authentication module first."

# Use references
"Reference the security guidelines from the previous conversation when writing this script."
```

#### Context Hierarchy
```bash
# Most important information first
"CRITICAL: This is for production use. Security is paramount.
Background: We need a port scanner
Requirements: Must be stealthy and configurable"

# Use headers for organization
"## Security Requirements
## Technical Specifications  
## Implementation Details"
```

## Workflow Optimization

### Iterative Refinement
```bash
# Start broad, then refine
"1. Give me a basic port scanner
2. Now add stealth capabilities
3. Add configuration options
4. Include error handling
5. Add logging and monitoring"

# Progressive enhancement
"First, create a simple version. Then, we'll add features one by one."
```

### Change Management
```bash
# Specific change requests
"Modify the port scanner to:
- Add timeout parameter (default: 5 seconds)
- Include service detection
- Output results in JSON format"

# Version control approach
"Create version 2.0 of the script with these improvements..."
```

### Quality Assurance Prompts
```bash
# Code review requests
"Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices
- Error handling"

# Testing prompts

```

## Context Management Strategies

### Memory Optimization
```bash
# Use summaries
"Summarize our conversation so far in 3 key points."

# Reference previous work
"Using the port scanner from earlier, add these features..."

# Clear context when switching topics
"Let's start fresh with a new topic: web application security."
```

### Context Switching
```bash
# Save important information
"Remember these key points for later:
- Target system: Linux
