When it comes to ethical hacking and digital reconnaissance, having the right tools is only half the equation. The other half is knowing when and how to use them responsibly. This growing collection represents my journey in building and customizing tools that prioritize ethical considerations alongside technical capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reconnaissance & Enumeration Tools

### Recon-Toolkit
*A modular Python toolkit for lightweight recon and passive footprinting.*

**Current Status:** Alpha stage, continuously improving  
**GitHub:** [Recon-Toolkit Repository](https://github.com/ZeroDumb/recon-toolkit)

The Recon-Toolkit emerged from a need to perform reconnaissance in a way that respects system boundaries and leaves minimal footprint. It's built with three core principles:
- Passive first, active second
- Respect rate limits and system boundaries
- Document everything, assume nothing

### Seven Sisters Framework
*Battle map for managing, automating, and learning reconnaissance through repeatable systems.*

**GitHub:** [Seven Sisters Repository](https://github.com/ZeroDumb/seven-sisters)

This framework represents my attempt to systematize the reconnaissance process while maintaining ethical guardrails. It's designed to help practitioners:
- Build consistent, repeatable processes
- Maintain clear documentation
- Enforce ethical boundaries programmatically

## üß∞ Scripts & Utilities in Development

### DNS Quick Resolve
*A lightweight DNS resolver for mapping subdomains without tripping alarms.*

**Status:** Coming soon  
**Key Features:**
- Rate-limited by design
- Passive DNS first
- Built-in ethical checks
- Comprehensive logging

### Passive Port Enumerator
*Scripted port scanning via passive OSINT methods without active probing.*

**Status:** Coming soon  
**Core Principles:**
- No direct system interaction
- Historical data aggregation
- Clear audit trails

## üìö Essential Reading & Resources

I've found these resources invaluable in developing both technical skills and ethical awareness:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)  
  *The foundation of web security understanding*

- [HackerOne Hacktivity](https://hackerone.com/hacktivity)  
  *Real-world examples of responsible disclosure*

- [Bugcrowd University](https://www.bugcrowd.com/hackers/bugcrowd-university/)  
  *Structured learning for ethical hacking*

## üöß Ethical Framework & Disclaimer

Every tool in this collection is developed with a strict ethical framework:

1. **Educational Purpose First**  
   These tools are built for learning and understanding, not exploitation.

2. **Defensive Mindset**  
   Each feature is designed with defensive research in mind.

3. **Responsible Usage**  
   All tools include rate limiting and logging by default.

4. **Clear Documentation**  
   Every function and feature is documented with both technical and ethical considerations.

Remember: These tools are for educational and ethical use only. I do not condone malicious use, and every tool is built with defensive research and educational purposes in mind.
